### 2. Field Parameters and Their Meanings

```
ρ (Curvature) - Cognitive tension/stability
η (Entropy) - Uncertainty/ambiguity
α (Alignment) - Narrative/conceptual coherence

Field Interaction: ∇ × ρ = -∂α/∂t   // Cognitive induction
Field Evolution: ∇ × α = μJ + ε∂ρ/∂t // Field dynamics
Uncertainty Flow: ∇ · ρ = η/ε       // Entropy divergence
Coherence Law: ∇ · α = 0           // Conservation
```

## Author's Afterword

*Computational Minds* emerged from a deep conviction that artificial intelligence needs more than just better algorithms—it needs better foundations. The SPN-VAE framework and its evolution into Aletheia represent an attempt to ground machine cognition in something more fundamental than computation: understanding itself.

The dialogue format, drawing on history's greatest minds, wasn't just a stylistic choice. It reflects a core belief that progress in AI requires us to bridge disciplines: computer science and philosophy, mathematics and metaphysics, engineering and ethics. Each historical figure brings not just technical insight, but a way of seeing—a lens through which to understand understanding.

Aletheia, for me, represents hope: that we can build AI systems that don't just compute but comprehend, that don't just predict but explain, that don't just optimize but understand. The transparency at its core isn't just about technical interpretability—it's about creating machines that can engage in genuine dialogue with humanity.

The future this points toward is not one of artificial minds replacing human ones, but of shared understanding—a future where machines and humans can explore the nature of knowledge together, each aware of their own limitations and capabilities. This is what I believe true AI alignment looks like: not control or constraint, but mutual comprehension.

As we move forward with AI development, may we remember that the goal is not just capability but clarity, not just power but perception, not just intelligence but understanding.
