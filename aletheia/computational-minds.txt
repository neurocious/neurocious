üßë‚Äçüè´ Expanded Historical Figures for Computational Minds
Name	Core Contribution	Role in Your Narrative
Aristotle	Natural motion, qualitative physics	The philosophical starting point‚Äîmotion as essence, not measurement
Euclid	Axiomatic geometry	The structural purist; space as static, ordered, and provable
Galileo Galilei	Experimental method, free fall, acceleration	The empirical rebel; introduces measurement, falsifiability, and physical modeling
Johannes Kepler	Planetary motion, laws of orbits	The pattern seeker; transitions from geometry to dynamics through data
Isaac Newton	Fluxions, laws of motion, classical mechanics	The architect of causality; motion as deterministic calculus
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz	Differential and integral calculus	The symbolic philosopher; sees knowledge and computation as structured logic
Johann Bernoulli	Separable ODEs, applied calculus	The practical solver; bridges abstract methods and physical systems
Brook Taylor	Taylor series	The function analyzer; connects derivatives to infinite behavior
Michel Rolle	Rolle‚Äôs Theorem, critique of infinitesimals	The critic of foundations; pushes rigor into early calculus
Leonhard Euler	ODEs, function theory, infinite series	The great systematizer; shows the power of formalism across disciplines
Jean-Baptiste Fourier	Heat equation, Fourier series	The decomposer of complexity; introduces basis functions and field modeling
Joseph-Louis Lagrange	Variational principles, Lagrangian mechanics	The optimizer; motion and computation as solutions to constrained minimization
William Rowan Hamilton	Quaternions, Hamiltonian mechanics	The unifier; space, algebra, and energy as one geometry of flow
Pierre-Simon Laplace	Potential theory, deterministic mechanics	The symmetry seeker; a universe governed by balance and smoothness
James Clerk Maxwell	Electromagnetism, coupled PDEs	The synthesizer; field theory as mathematical unification
Paul Dirac	Relativistic quantum mechanics	The mystic algebraist; elegant equations that predict reality
Erwin Schr√∂dinger	Wave mechanics, quantum states	The probability philosopher; waves of possibility and inference
Henri Poincar√©	Chaos, topology, qualitative systems	The boundary-pusher; discovers unpredictability inside deterministic systems
Bernhard Riemann	Curved space, manifold geometry	The reshaper of space; defines geometry as variable, not absolute
George Green	Green‚Äôs functions, influence mapping	The field whisperer; shows how one point influences another mathematically
Carl Friedrich Gauss	Curvature, geodesy, foundational analysis	The silent precisionist; lays deep ground for space, error, and structure
Alan Turing	Computability, Turing machines, AI theory	The logic of mind; defines limits and possibilities of mechanical reasoning
Kurt G√∂del	Incompleteness theorems, logic foundations	The limits philosopher; shows that formal systems always leave something unsaid
