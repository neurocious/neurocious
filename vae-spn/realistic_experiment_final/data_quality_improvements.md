# Financial Data Quality Improvements

## Problem Identified

The original experiment showed **β-VAE achieving 98% market prediction accuracy**, which is:
- **Impossible in real markets** (professional funds achieve 10-20% annual returns)
- **Due to synthetic training data** with perfect labels and deterministic patterns
- **Misleading for evaluating model capabilities**

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Realistic Market Simulation (`realistic_market_simulation.py`)

**Replaced artificial patterns with realistic market characteristics:**

- **Fat-tailed returns**: Student t-distribution (not normal)
- **Volatility clustering**: GARCH-like persistence 
- **Regime persistence**: 95%+ chance of staying in same regime
- **Autocorrelation**: Slight negative correlation (mean reversion)
- **Market microstructure**: Bid-ask spreads, transaction costs, order flow
- **Economic indicators**: Unemployment, inflation, interest rates with mean reversion

**Key Features:**
```python
# Realistic regime transition (not deterministic)
regime_transition_matrix = {
    MarketRegime.BULL: {MarketRegime.BULL: 0.95, MarketRegime.BEAR: 0.005},
    # Much more persistence than random switching
}

# Fat tails and skewness
return = stats.t.rvs(df=4.0, loc=drift, scale=volatility)

# Transaction costs reduce performance
strategy_returns = positions * actual_returns - transaction_costs
```

### 2. Proper Financial Evaluation (`realistic_evaluation.py`)

**Replaced meaningless accuracy metrics with industry-standard financial metrics:**

#### Risk-Adjusted Performance:
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns (>1.0 is excellent)
- **Calmar Ratio**: Return vs maximum drawdown
- **Information Ratio**: Active return vs tracking error

#### Risk Management:
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough loss
- **Value at Risk (95%)**: Expected worst-case loss
- **Expected Shortfall**: Average loss beyond VaR

#### Trading Metrics:
- **Hit Rate**: 50-60% is realistic (not 98%)
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit / gross loss
- **Win/Loss Ratio**: Average win vs average loss

#### Realistic Benchmarks:
```python
benchmarks = {
    'Random Walk': {'hit_rate': 0.50, 'sharpe_ratio': 0.5},
    'Professional Fund': {'hit_rate': 0.58, 'sharpe_ratio': 0.86},
    'Top Quant Fund': {'hit_rate': 0.62, 'sharpe_ratio': 1.5}
}
```

### 3. Financial Training Objectives (`realistic_training_objectives.py`)

**Updated loss function to focus on what matters in finance:**

#### Primary Objectives (70% weight):
1. **Risk-Adjusted Returns** (30%): Maximize Sharpe ratio
2. **Uncertainty Calibration** (20%): High confidence → low error
3. **Capital Preservation** (15%): Asymmetric loss (losses hurt 2x more)

#### Secondary Objectives (30% weight):
4. **Regime Consistency** (15%): Adapt behavior to market regimes
5. **Reconstruction** (10%): Learn representations (reduced importance)
6. **Transaction Costs** (5%): Penalize excessive trading

```python
# Asymmetric loss for capital preservation
losses = torch.clamp(strategy_returns, max=0)  # Only losses
gains = torch.clamp(strategy_returns, min=0)   # Only gains
asymmetric_loss = -gains + 2.0 * torch.abs(losses)  # Losses hurt 2x more
```

## Expected Results with Improved Data

### Realistic Performance Targets:

| Level | Annual Return | Sharpe Ratio | Hit Rate | Max Drawdown |
|-------|---------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Minimum Viable** | 8% | 0.5 | 52% | 20% |
| **Good Performance** | 12% | 0.8 | 55% | 15% |
| **Excellent** | 18% | 1.2 | 60% | 10% |
| **World-Class** | 25% | 1.8 | 65% | 8% |

### Why These Targets Matter:

1. **Hit Rate 60%** is exceptional (not 98%)
2. **Sharpe Ratio 1.0+** indicates good risk management
3. **Max Drawdown <15%** shows capital preservation
4. **Transaction costs** significantly impact real performance

## Neurocious Advantages with Realistic Data

The improved evaluation should highlight Neurocious's unique strengths:

1. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Know when predictions are unreliable
2. **Regime Adaptation**: Different strategies for bull/bear/volatile markets
3. **Explainable Decisions**: Spatial belief navigation provides interpretability
4. **Risk Management**: Field-aware priors help with tail risk

## Implementation Impact

The new framework:
- **Eliminates artificial 98% accuracy**
- **Focuses on realistic 55-60% hit rates**
- **Emphasizes risk management over raw prediction**
- **Enables proper comparison with financial baselines**
- **Highlights where spatial belief navigation truly adds value**

## Next Steps

1. **Replace** `belief_nav_task.py` market simulation with `realistic_market_simulation.py`
2. **Update** evaluation metrics in `baseline.py` to use `realistic_evaluation.py`
3. **Integrate** `realistic_training_objectives.py` into the training loop
4. **Re-run** experiments with proper expectations (55-60% accuracy, not 98%)
5. **Demonstrate** Neurocious's uncertainty quantification advantages

This transforms the experiment from "memorizing synthetic patterns" to "learning real financial decision-making under uncertainty."
