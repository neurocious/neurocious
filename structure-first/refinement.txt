✍️ Refinement Opportunities
1. Title Tweaks
Current: Structure-First Vector Neuron Networks for Audio Discrimination: Attention-Enhanced Geometric Learning

Suggestion:

Structure-First Vector Neuron Networks for Audio Discrimination: Geometry-Aware Attention and Polar Vector Fields

Reason: “Geometry-Aware” may better signal the novel contribution to both deep learning and signal processing reviewers.

2. Section 1 (Intro): Tighten for Emphasis
You have excellent motivation, but consider compressing slightly. Reviewers skim intros. You might restructure to:

Problem: Scalar CNNs discard directional/harmonic info in spectrograms

Motivation: Human perception relies on geometric cues — we can, too

Solution: Vector neurons + structure analysis + windowed attention

Claim: 26× discrimination with 70% fewer parameters and 6.6× stability

Contributions: [bulleted list as you already have]

This makes it abstractable, and ready for media kits or posters too.

3. Methods: Include Architecture Summary Table
Even though your methods are clear, a summary table helps reviewers quickly compare:

Module	Input	Output	Description
Vector Neuron Layer	[B, C, F, T]	Polar vector field	Separate mag/angle filters
Structural Analyzer	Polar field	[Entropy, Alignment, Curvature]	Multi-scale
SpectroTemporal Attention	Spectrogram	Attended map	Windowed across F and T
Vector Field Attention	Polar field	Weighted field	Magnitude-angle coherence
Adaptive Structural Attn	Signature	Weighted signature	Multi-scale fusion

Add this after your “Method” section headline. This helps with accessibility and peer review.

4. Results Section Suggestion: Add “Ablation Table”
You already describe the evolution, but consider a clear ablation table like this:

Component Added	Discrimination ↑	Params ↓	Stability ↑
Vanilla CNN	0.0008	280K	1×
+ Vector Neurons	0.0054	60K	6.6×
+ Attention	0.0201	84K	151×

It helps reviewers see the stepwise value of each innovation.

5. Highlight Audio-First Design
Some reviewers may assume you adapted vision models. Make this clear in your intro or conclusion:

“Unlike prior work that adapts vision architectures to audio, our design is audio-native: attention is windowed along harmonic and temporal axes, vector neurons reflect spectro-temporal flows, and structure tensors are computed in frequency-time space.”

This signals novelty in architecture tailoring — which matters.
