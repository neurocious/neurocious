In the SeqVAE-SPN framework, beliefs (like “this image is a cat”) aren’t isolated decisions — they’re narrative attractors formed by latent evidence flowing through structured vector fields. The “why” of a belief — meaning, the specific contributing features or causes — is inferred through a combination of trajectory analysis, field attribution, and reverse routing.

Let’s walk through how this works using your example:

“I believe this image is of a cat, because it has whiskers and soft fur, but not because of the eye shape.”

🔍 Step 1: Encode the Input
The image is encoded into a latent vector by the SeqVAE.

This vector captures the compressed epistemic fingerprint of the image (including features like whiskers, fur texture, eye shape, ears, etc.).

🧭 Step 2: Route Through the SPN
The latent vector is passed through the Spatial Probability Network.

The SPN routes the latent vector toward belief regions — in this case, toward the “cat” attractor basin.

The trajectory followed in latent space reveals which feature directions were responsible for this routing.

🧠 Step 3: Attribution via Field Differentials
For each dimension of the latent vector (corresponding to learned feature axes), we calculate field attribution:

Edit
float contribution = Vector.Dot(latent, vectorField[i]);
This shows how much each feature direction pulled the belief toward "cat".

Features with high attribution (e.g. whiskers, fur texture) contributed strongly.

Features with low or negative attribution (e.g. eye shape) had little or no effect.

🔄 Step 4: Reverse Routing for Counterfactuals
To ask “What if this image didn’t have fur?”, we can perturb the latent vector (remove the fur signal) and re-route.

If the belief shifts away from “cat,” then fur is causally responsible.

This is how the system builds counterfactual narratives:

“Without whiskers and fur, the image no longer flows into the cat attractor.”

🧩 Step 5: Epistemic Explanation Output
From these dynamics, you can generate an explanation like:

Belief: "This is a cat."
Causal contributors:
– Whisker structure: strong positive vector alignment
– Fur texture: high curvature → attractor basin entry
– Eye shape: low contribution; not aligned with routing vector

Justification: The belief flowed into the “cat” region due to strong semantic pull from whisker and fur features. Other features (e.g. eye shape) were present but did not contribute meaningfully to routing stability.

There Are Opportunities to Extend It
If you want to make belief attribution and explanation a first-class output, here’s how you could evolve the SPN:

1. Feature Attribution Layer
Add a module that tracks the dot products between the latent vector and each vector field component:

csharp
Copy
Edit
float contribution = Vector.Dot(latent, vectorField[i]);
Aggregate these into a BeliefExplanation object:

csharp
Copy
Edit
class BeliefExplanation {
    public string BeliefLabel;
    public Dictionary<string, float> FeatureContributions;
    public float Confidence;
}
2. Attractor Tracing Tools
Implement trajectory logging during routing:

Save the path through latent space over steps or updates.

Use this to visualize convergence toward attractors.

Could be used for introspection or debugging.

3. Counterfactual API
Create a helper function:

csharp
Copy
Edit
BeliefExplanation GetCounterfactual(PradOp original, string featureToSuppress);
It perturbs the latent vector (zeroing out certain axes), reroutes, and shows belief shift.

4. Belief Narratives Output
Allow the system to emit something like:

“I believe this is a cat. This belief was driven by high alignment with whisker and fur vectors. Removing whiskers caused belief to shift toward ‘rabbit’.”

That turns your SPN into a transparent epistemic engine — a system that can not only believe, but explain why.

here's a clean and minimal sketch of how to integrate a BeliefExplanation class into your existing SpatialProbabilityNetwork architecture without disrupting its core logic.

🧱 BeliefExplanation Class
This class captures the “why” behind a belief in structured form:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public class BeliefExplanation
{
    public string BeliefLabel { get; set; }              // Optional classification label (if applicable)
    public Dictionary<string, float> FeatureContributions { get; set; } = new(); // E.g. "whiskers" => 0.82
    public float Confidence { get; set; }
    public FieldParameters FieldParams { get; set; }     // Curvature, Entropy, Alignment
    public string Justification { get; set; }            // Human-readable summary
}
If you're not using explicit labels (like “cat”), you can still treat BeliefLabel as the vector attractor region name or tag (could even be cluster ID, or just "Top-1 Region").

⚙️ Modifying ProcessState
Update the return value of ProcessState to include a BeliefExplanation:

csharp
Copy
Edit
public (PradResult routing, PradResult confidence, PradResult policy, PradResult reflexes, PradResult predictions, FieldParameters fieldParams, BeliefExplanation explanation) 
ProcessState(PradOp state)
At the end of ProcessState, after you’ve computed routing, confidence, and fieldParams, generate an explanation like this:

🔎 Belief Attribution in ProcessState
You can inject this right before the final return:

csharp
Copy
Edit
var latent = vaeModel != null ? vaeModel.Encode(state) : state;
var explanation = GenerateBeliefExplanation(latent, routing, fieldParams, confidence);
Then return it as part of your output tuple.

🧠 GenerateBeliefExplanation Implementation
csharp
Copy

private BeliefExplanation GenerateBeliefExplanation(
    PradOp latent, PradResult routing, 
    FieldParameters fieldParams, PradResult confidence)
{
    var contributions = new Dictionary<string, float>();
    var latentData = latent.Result.Data;
    var vectorFieldTensor = vectorField.CurrentTensor;

    // Assume vector field is flattened over [H, W, D]
    int vectorCount = vectorFieldTensor.Shape[0] * vectorFieldTensor.Shape[1];
    int vectorDim = latentData.Length;

    for (int i = 0; i < vectorDim; i++)
    {
        // Sum all field vectors in this dimension
        double sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < vectorCount; j++)
        {
            int idx = j * vectorDim + i;
            sum += vectorFieldTensor.Data[idx];
        }

        double avg = sum / vectorCount;
        float contribution = (float)(latentData[i] * avg);
        contributions[$"feature_{i}"] = contribution;
    }

    var topContributors = contributions
        .OrderByDescending(kv => Math.Abs(kv.Value))
        .Take(3)
        .ToDictionary(kv => kv.Key, kv => kv.Value);

    var justification = string.Join(", ",
        topContributors.Select(kv => $"{kv.Key} ↦ {kv.Value:F3}"));

    return new BeliefExplanation
    {
        BeliefLabel = "TopAttractor", // Optional
        Confidence = confidence.Result.Data[0],
        FeatureContributions = topContributors,
        FieldParams = fieldParams,
        Justification = $"Belief routed due to: {justification}"
    };
