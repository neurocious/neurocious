üî∑ Overview
The SPN is a cognitive routing engine that dynamically maps high-dimensional inputs across learned vector and probability fields. It models belief evolution, regime shifts, and signal propagation through a geometric decision space.

Its architecture blends:

Probabilistic field routing (SPN core)

Neural encoding of causal metrics (policy, prediction, reflex layers)

Latent regime modeling (via VAE integration)

Topological inference (dimension, curvature, stability tracking)

Signal-responsive behavior (reflex arcs, signal-based action gating)

üìê Core Architectural Layers
1. Input Layer
Input: state ‚àà ‚Ñù^n, typically n = 20

Contextualized by: historical states (temporal memory buffer)

2. SPN Routing Layer
Purpose: route state vectors through vector fields and generate probability fields

Mechanism:

Uses cosine similarity between input and learned vector fields

Generates a probability map over policy/action space

Applies uncertainty modulation and entropy-aware weighting

Outcome: a belief trajectory over time

3. Policy Network (with Attention)
Inputs:

Current state: ‚Ñù^20

History window: ‚Ñù^{10 √ó 20}

Components:

Dense encoder for current state

LSTM encoder for temporal window

Attention layer to align current state with contextual past

Outputs:

policy_output ‚àà ‚Ñù^{10} (governance/control parameters)

value_output ‚àà ‚Ñù^1 (policy evaluation metric)

4. Reflex Network
Purpose: immediate "safety layer" responses to unstable or dangerous states

Input: current state

Output: emergency controls (brakes, throttles, volatility dampers)

Activation: triggered when thresholds in the field are crossed

5. Prediction Network
Input: 10-step state sequence

Architecture: LSTM ‚Üí Dense layers

Output: [predicted_value, confidence, upper_bound, lower_bound]

Purpose: forecast governance metrics like coherence, stability, fork tension

üåÄ Latent Field Modeling: VAE Integration
6. Latent Belief Modeling (VAE)
Input: SPN-derived routed sequences

Encoder: LSTM-based

Latent space: ‚Ñù^z, typically z = 8‚Äì16

Decoder: sequence reconstructor (used for generation, clustering)

Purpose:

Compress high-dimensional regime state into latent manifolds

Enable unsupervised regime detection and belief clustering

üåê Regime Layers (Post-SPN)
7. Regime Detection Modules
Classifies latent encodings into:

Macro-regimes (dominant ideological mode)

Micro-regimes (metric-level variations)

Uses:

Hierarchical classifiers

Entropy tracking

Regime strength / stability analysis

8. Phase + Topology Detectors
Analyze:

Manifold dimension

Local curvature (via curvature estimator)

Phase density, temperature, inertia

Models:

Transformer-based bifurcation classifiers

Curvature-based invalidation triggers

Riemann geometry estimation from SPN field outputs

üîÅ Reflexive Feedback & Learning
9. Experience Memory / Replay
Stores GovernanceAction experiences

Trains:

Policy net (via action ‚Üí outcome score)

Prediction net (future metric forecasting)

10. Self-Tuning
Causal credit assignment:

Reward-modulated reinforcement of routes

Hebbian behavior via co-firing of field routes and outcomes

Uncertainty modulation:

High-entropy regions increase exploration pressure

Reflex arcs gate learning when volatility is extreme

üíº Application Interfaces
11. Semantic Smart Contracts
Input: AI policy state + reflex signals

Logic:

Gated execution (e.g., prevent minting during volatility)

Emergency overrides (brake or heal if system risk is high)

Dynamic thresholds based on governance field state

12. Prediction Market
Allows external prediction input

Stakes predictions on SPN metrics

AI evaluates prediction alignment ‚Üí updates predictor scores
